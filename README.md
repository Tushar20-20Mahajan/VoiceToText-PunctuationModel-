# VoiceToText-PunctuationModel-
This project converts a pre-trained BERT model for token classification into a CoreML model for iOS, enabling punctuation restoration in transcriptions. The model is optimized for on-device inference, making it ideal for real-time transcription apps. It supports efficient, privacy-preserving processing directly on iOS devices.
Description: This project aims to build an iOS-compatible machine learning model for punctuation restoration in transcriptions. Using Hugging Face's pre-trained BERT model, the model is fine-tuned for token classification tasks and then converted to CoreML format to run efficiently on iOS devices. The goal is to enable real-time punctuation restoration in transcriptions, such as converting a simple sentence without punctuation into one with correct punctuation marks.

Key Features:
Pre-trained Model: Utilizes the Hugging Face BERT model (bert-base-uncased), a state-of-the-art transformer, for token classification tasks.
CoreML Conversion: Converts the model from PyTorch to CoreML using coremltools to deploy it on iOS devices.
Punctuation Restoration: Aimed at restoring punctuation marks like periods, commas, etc., in transcriptions.
Efficient Inference: The model is optimized for on-device inference, enabling fast, privacy-preserving processing without relying on cloud services.
iOS Deployment: The model is packaged in the .mlpackage format, making it easy to integrate into iOS apps for real-time transcription applications.
How It Works:
Model Training: The project uses a pre-trained token classification model from Hugging Face's Transformers library. This model is designed to predict punctuation tokens (e.g., period, comma) for given text input.
Input Text: The input is a transcription without punctuation (e.g., "this is an example of a transcription without punctuation").
CoreML Conversion: After testing and fine-tuning, the model is traced and converted into a CoreML model, which can be used directly in iOS apps.
Deployment: The CoreML model is packaged as .mlpackage, making it ready for easy integration into iOS apps with real-time NLP capabilities.
