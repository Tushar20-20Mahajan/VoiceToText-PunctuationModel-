# VoiceToText-PunctuationModel-
This project converts a pre-trained BERT model for token classification into a CoreML model for iOS, enabling punctuation restoration in transcriptions. The model is optimized for on-device inference, making it ideal for real-time transcription apps. It supports efficient, privacy-preserving processing directly on iOS devices.
